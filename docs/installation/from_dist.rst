==================================
Installation pre-compiled binary
==================================

On the `GitHub <https://github.com/gustafklinga/sermoncut>`_ page, navigate to the *dist* folder. Download the latest
version and extract to folder of your choice.

In order for SermonCut to work it needs FFmpeg. Download the windows binarys from https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/.
Then move *ffmpeg.exe* and *ffprobe.exe* from the */bin* folder to the *SermonCut* folder.

Start SermonCut by double-clicking on SermonCut.exe. Now sermoncut will create a *sermoncut.ini* file with the settings, and also some log-files.
