Autotagging
===================
*This is specially written for use with files generated by Yamaha LS9, and may be changed in the future*

Autotagging is a function to fetch information from the inputfile ID3 tags in order to automatically
fill some of the export tags and name. This is only able to be used on MP3-files.

This is specially written for use with files generated by Yamaha LS9 recording function which will save an mp3 with
a ID3-tag title in the format: "Untitled month/day/year timestamp"


**Autotagging title**

Enabled in sermoncut.ini by setting *autotag_title* to 1.

When autotag_title is enabled it will fetch the ID3 tag of the input file. Then it will fetch the second part of the
title which will contain a date in the format "month/day/year".

Based on this you can change autotag_title_format to automatically generate a title. Example: autotag_title_format set
to "Sermon {}-{}-{}" will automatically fill the export tag title to "Sermon (year)-(month)-(day)"

**Auto fill exportname**

By setting *export_based_on_autotag* to 1. The filename of the exportfile will automatically be set to
"year-month-day.mp3"
